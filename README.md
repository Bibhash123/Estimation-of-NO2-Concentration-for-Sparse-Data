# Estimation-of-NO2-Concentration-for-Sparse-Data
This repository consists of the code implementation for the paper titled "Estimating Near-Surface Nitrogen DioxideConcentration From Sparse Satellite Dataset". The work deals with the estimation of near-surface concentration of Nitrogen Dioxide over an area above southern europe using satellite measured tropospheric vertical column density values.

For the mitigation of the threat of pollution, round-the-clock measurement of atmospheric pollutants is imperative.Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) is one of the major atmospheric pollu-tants, having adverse effect on human health. Traditionally,insitumeasurement strategies have been used for monitoring NO2concentrations, thus limiting the study only to urban locationswhere monitoring stations are available. Satellite monitoringoffers a truly global alternative. In recent years various methodshave been proposed for estimation of near-surface concentrationsusing tropospheric vertical column densities. These methodsuse a number of other variables such as weather parameters,demographic attributes, and geographic parameters. In this workwe study the performance of a Convolutional Neural Networkfor the task in an univariate scenario, i.e with only troposphericVCD as the regressor, It is found that when the data is sparse innature, the CNN shows a RMSE score of 14.692Î¼g/m3, and isoutperformed by methods such as Linear Regression, XGBoostand LightGBM. However, as the sparsity in data reduces, CNNperforms better than the other methods considered for the study.
